#Performance Comparison of OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and Local LLM (Ollama Mistral) Using Streamlit
Response Time
•	OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo responds significantly faster compared to the local LLM. This quicker response time can be attributed to the highly optimized infrastructure and powerful hardware on OpenAI's servers. However, it also reflects the efficiency of network communication and API handling.
CPU Usage
•	The CPU usage for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo is relatively high. This suggests that even though the model runs on remote servers, the local machine is still heavily engaged in processing tasks related to network communication, data handling, and possibly waiting for the response.
•	In contrast, the local LLM uses less CPU on the local machine. This is likely because it offloads much of the computational work to the GPU or other specialized hardware components, reducing the load on the CPU.
Memory Usage
•	Memory usage is high for OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo, which could be due to the overhead associated with handling API requests, maintaining network connections, and managing data before and after the call.
•	The local LLM also uses a substantial amount of memory, though less than GPT-3.5-turbo. This is expected as running a model locally requires significant memory resources for model loading and inference tasks, though it might be more optimized for the local environment.
